# Frontend Bootstrap

You can start developing by running:

```
$ npm run start
```

Or you can build it like:

```
$ npm run build
```


Run your tests like so:

```
$ npm run test
```

I want to add a few more scripts, like validation and whatnot.


### Todo:

[ x ] Build as external CSS file
- Better production building
