# Frontend Bootstrap

This does not come with postcss, because we are using SASS, so there's no need, the new version of tailwind also purges CSS too which is great!

You can start developing by running:

```
$ npm run start
```

Or you can build it like:

```
$ npm run build
```


Run your tests like so:

```
$ npm run test
```

I want to add a few more scripts, like validation and whatnot.


### Todo:

- Build as external CSS file
- Better production building
